# fMRI-Alzheimers-Connectivity

A Python project simulating fMRI BOLD signals to study brain connectivity in normal and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) conditions, with a focus on sensorimotor networks and proprioception.

## Overview
- Simulates neural activity for 5 ROIs: Motor, Sensory, Hippocampus, Prefrontal, Occipital.
- Convolves signals with an HRF to generate BOLD data.
- Computes and visualizes connectivity matrices and network graphs.
- Models reduced connectivity in AD, reflecting proprioceptive impairments.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/ArshiaVahedi/fMRI-Alzheimers-Connectivity.git`
2. Navigate to folder: `cd fMRI-Alzheimers-Connectivity`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run: `python fmri_connectivity.py`
5. View outputs: `connectivity_matrices.png`, `normal_connectivity_graph.png`, `alzheimer's_connectivity_graph.png`

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- NetworkX

## Relevance
This project highlights my skills in Python, neuroimaging simulation, and neuroscience, aligning with my research in Alzheimer’s, proprioception, and connectivity analysis via EEG/fMRI.
