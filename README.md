# fMRI-Alzheimers-Connectivity

A Python project simulating fMRI BOLD signals to study brain connectivity in normal and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) conditions, with a focus on sensorimotor networks and proprioception.

## Overview
- Simulates neural activity for 5 ROIs: Motor, Sensory, Hippocampus, Prefrontal, Occipital.
- Convolves signals with an HRF to generate BOLD data.
- Computes and visualizes connectivity matrices and network graphs.
- Models reduced connectivity in AD, reflecting proprioceptive impairments.
